## üß† OOP Concepts Used

| Concept         | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Account data is protected via private attributes and public getters/setters |
| **Abstraction**   | `Account` is an abstract base class that defines shared functionality       |
| **Inheritance**   | `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` inherit from the `Account` class     |
| **Polymorphism**  | Methods like `withdraw()` and `get_account_summary()` behave differently by account type |
